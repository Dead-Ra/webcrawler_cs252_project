authors are advised that reviewing turnaround time is subject to fluctuations in submission rates, which are expected to be higher toward the end of the annual cycle.

the revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors. to this end, reviewers bear a responsibility to request revisions only in constructive scenarios: when requests can be addressed by specific and modest efforts that can lead to acceptance within the revision timeframe. in turn, authors bear the responsibility of attempting to meet those requests within the stated timeframe, or of withdrawing the paper from submission. at the discretion of the program committee, mechanisms may be employed for reviewers and authors to engage in further dialog during the revision period.

the objective of the one-day workshop is to understand impact of modern hardware technologies on accelerating core components of data management workloads (which include traditional oltp, data warehousing/olap, etl, streaming/real-time workloads, business analytics workloads such as text analytics, data mining, machine learning, graph analytics, rdf processing, and big data processing) using modern processors (e.g., commodity and specialized multi-core, gpus, and fpgas), storage systems (e.g., storage-class memories like ssds and phase-change memory), and hybrid programming models like cuda, opencl, and openacc. specifically, the workshop hopes to explore the interplay between overall system design, core algorithms, query optimization strategies, programming approaches, performance modelling and evaluation, etc., from the perspective of data management applications.

in today's competitive and highly dynamic environment, analyzing data to understand how the business is performing and to predict outcomes and trends has become critical. the traditional approach to reporting is no longer adequate. instead users now demand easy-to-use intelligent platforms and applications capable of analyzing real-time data to provide insight and actionable information at the right time. the end goal is to support better and timelier decision making, enabled by the availability of up-to-date, high quality information. although there has been progress in this direction and many companies are introducing products towards meeting this goal, there is still a long way to go. in particular, the whole lifecycle of business intelligence requires innovative techniques and methodologies capable of dealing with the requirements imposed by these new generation of bi applications. from the capture of real-time business data to the transformation and delivery of actionable information, all the stages of the business intelligence (bi) cycle call for new algorithms and paradigms to support value-added functionalities. these functionalities include dynamic integration of real-time data feeds from operational sources, optimization and evolution of etl transformations and analytical models, and dynamic generation of adaptive real-time dashboards, just to name a few. the series of birte workshops, starting in 2006, have always been held in conjunction with vldb. the series aims to provide a forum to discuss topics related to this emerging field and set research directions towards making business intelligence more real-time. following the success of previous birte editions (2006, 2008-2012) submissions for research, industrial and position papers on relevant topics are encouraged.

crowdsourcing systems, such as amazon mechanical turk and crowdflower, utilize human power to perform difficult tasks, such as entity resolution, search, filtering, image matching, or clustering. the important issues of collecting and managing the large volume of data in these applications have attracted plenty of attention from the database community. the goal of dbcrowd 2013, the first vldb workshop on databases and crowdsourcing, is to provide an avenue for database researchers and practitioners to disseminate and explore new research directions and promising results at the confluence of crowdsourcing and database areas.

 user context, spatial data, and multimedia data. the international workshop on information management for mobile applications aims at a broad range of mobile application fields and wants to provide a forum for the discussion about technologies and mechanisms, which support the management of mobile, complex, integrated, distributed, and heterogeneous data-focused applications.

with the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud business intelligence "as a service" offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud start-ups and major bi industry vendors. beyond porting bi features into the cloud, which already implies numerous issues (e.g., bigdata/nosql database modeling and storage, data localization, security and privacy, performance, cost and usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges for making data analytics available to small and medium-size enterprises (smes), non-governmental organizations, web communities (e.g., supported by social networks), and even the average citizen; this vision presumably requiring a mixture of both private and open data. the aim of the cloud-i workshop is to become an interdisciplinary, regular exchange forum for researchers, industry and practitioners, as well as all potential users of cloud intelligence. the submission of research, industrial, position, visionary, survey and student papers are encouraged to fuel up the discussion.

the objective of the one-day workshop is to understand impact of modern hardware technologies on accelerating core components of data management workloads (which include traditional oltp, data warehousing/olap, etl, streaming/real-time workloads, business analytics workloads such as text analytics, data mining, machine learning, graph analytics, rdf processing, and big data processing) using modern processors (e.g., commodity and specialized multi-core, gpus, and fpgas), storage systems (e.g., storage-class memories like ssds and phase-change memory), and hybrid programming models like cuda, opencl, and openacc. specifically, the workshop hopes to explore the interplay between overall system design, core algorithms, query optimization strategies, programming approaches, performance modelling and evaluation, etc., from the perspective of data management applications.

as the amount of streaming data produced by large-scale systems such as environmental monitoring, scientific experiments and communication networks grows rapidly, new approaches are needed to effectively process and analyze such data. there are several promising directions in the area of large-scale distributed computation, that is, where multiple computing entities work together over partitions of the massive, streaming data to perform complex computations. two important paradigms in this realm are continuous distributed monitoring (i.e., continually maintaining an accurate estimate of a complex query), and distributed and cluster-based systems that allow the processing of big, streaming data (e.g., ibm system s, amazon s4, and twitter storm). the aim of the bd3 workshop is to bring together computer scientists with interests in this field to present recent innovations, find topics of common interest and to stimulate further development of new approaches to deal with massive dynamic and distributed data.
